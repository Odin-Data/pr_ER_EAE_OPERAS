# PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH PROJECT
Collaboration on a psychology research project for the development of basic statistical analysis and statistical inference. This project focuses on the results of 3 psychometric tests: resilience (ER), stress (EAE), and personality (OPERAS).

The psychometric tests used for the study are as follows:

- Resilience Scale (ER) by Wagnild, G. & Young, H.
- Stress Appreciation Scale (EAE), Scale G, by authors J.L. Fernández Seara & N. Mielgo Robles.
- Overall Personality Assessment Scale (OPERAS)


## Datasets

This repository contains datasets compiled by psychologist Meritxell Molina Ferré. These data are being shared publicly for use in research projects and data analysis. Please note that these datasets are subject to a license; see the [License](#license) section for details.

The dataset contains 3 main files:

- 'WAGNILD AND YOUNG RESILIENCE SCALE (1-92)_v1.xlsx': file with the responses from the ER test.
- 'FINAL DEGREE PROJECT (1-154)_v2.xlsx': file with the responses from the EAE and OPERAS tests.
- 'TEST OPERAS FET_v2.xlsx': this file contains the personality T results for each individual.

For the personality test of the Overall Personality Assessment Scale (OPERAS), the results have been obtained directly on an individual basis through a web application provided by the University Rovira i Virgili and have not been processed in the attached notebooks. The results are located in the 'datasets' folder, in the file 'TEST OPERAS FET_v2.xlsx'.

## Notebooks

Two notebooks are presented:

- pr_EAE_OPERAS: Statistical analysis of the results from the EAE and OPERAS tests.
- pr_ER: Statistical analysis of the results from the ER test.
